extends: default

rules:
  line-length:
    # USYNC: (max) line length shared among: black, flake8, isort, doc8, yamllint.
    max: 88

    # Note that long http links and file names are allowed by default:
    #   allow-non-breakable-words: true
    # but yamllint will error if there's more than one space between a
    # comment character and the start of the link, i.e., no indenting,
    # and it'll error if you don't break the long line to its own.

    # There's also an inline-mappings variant of non-breakable, but it
    # seems to apply to data, not comments. You could enable it so:
    #
    #   allow-non-breakable-inline-mappings: true

    # level: warning

  # yamllint assumes the 'on' in GH Actions workflows is a truthy value
  # (along with 'yes', 'no', 'true', 'false', etc.), e.g.,
  #   on:
  #     - push
  # generates the 'truthy' warning, "truthy value should be one of [false, true]".
  # - There are many ways to ignore this rule.
  #   - At the line:
  #       # yamllint disable-line rule:truthy
  #       on: ...
  #   - But not checking key values here:
  #       truthy:
  #         check-keys: false
  #   - Or probably the least disruptive and most general, adding a value
  #     to allowed-values, whose default is:
  #         allowed-values: ['true', 'false']
  # CXREF:
  # https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rules.html#module-yamllint.rules.truthy
  truthy:
    allowed-values: ['true', 'false', 'on']
